# EPIQEK 

This repository contains all files for "EPIQEK" project developed by Ilja Pavlovs and Ruslan Ibragimov during the course of Pasqal [Re]generative Hackathon challenge. In this project we propose a solution for the epitope prediction problem, crucial in vaccine development.

## Files
- qaoa.ipynb contains all code needed to run the simulations.
- EPIQEK_Data_Acquisition_And_Processing contains code used to generate graph representation of proteins. 
Directory data_graphs contains directories with graphs for epitopes and non-epitopes saved in .csv format.
